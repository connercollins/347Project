Suggestions for Enhancement and bugs:
- Automatically choose the correct type for inserts
- More helpful errors 
- Unique constraints e.g. don't allow duplicate ids
- Retrieving from multiple relationships can cause 
an array index out of bounds exception 
- Editing and deleting entries in the DB 
- A different framework could be better suited to 
the implementation of SIM e.g. Django
